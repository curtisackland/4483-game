  description: A silenced pistol, also known as a suppressor-equipped handgun, is
    a firearm modified with a suppressor or silencer attachment to reduce the noise
    and muzzle flash generated upon firing. These weapons are designed for discreet
    operation, minimizing sound signature and muzzle blast, making them favored by
    special forces, covert operatives, and for clandestine operations where stealth
    is paramount. Silenced pistols offer enhanced stealth capabilities while maintaining
    lethality, often used in scenarios requiring quiet engagement or covert assassinations.
